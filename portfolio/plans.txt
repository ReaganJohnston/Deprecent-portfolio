Who am I?
---------

I was never the best at school or academics, I'm just a super curious guy. This website exists to share and motivate me to continue
developing my ideas. As it documents my projects and challenges, I hope in the near future I would have more abstract knowledge to continue
creating crazier projects. 

A recent interest of mine was cyber-securiy. Cryptography, enumeration, Privilege Escalation and Pen-testing are all very interesting apsects
to research into. Continuing foward I can't wait to delve deaper, and apply the knowledge for further projects. 

Hello! my name is Reagan Johnston and Iâ€™m a software developer and offensive cyber-security analyst.
Over the course of three years, I have learnt many skills, applications, frameworks and enumeration techniques to 
satisfy my curiosity.
