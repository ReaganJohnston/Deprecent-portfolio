- Card Themed
- Soft gray background NOT BLACK
- Use purple as the primary
- Purple loading when changing pages
- Card flicking sound when hovering over the cards
- Change Navbar to have a cluster on the right hand side with all the icons

==========================================================================================
Issues and things needing to be implemented:
- Navbar icons, and links don't work when Nav__black is setup
- Setup experience and skills cards
- Fixed up the absolute and relative bug, need to implement this as the website looks a bit 
  bad on the laptop
- Accomodate for incredibly small screen sizes, Javascrip Y-SCREEN-INDENT cases
- Add in a contact forum for users to contact you 
- Selecting navbar links moves the page down according to the selected item
- Setup Linked in page
- Setup Instagram page
- Appropriate the README github portfolio and projects pages
- Create resume and potential cover letter
- Have all these items done within the next week
